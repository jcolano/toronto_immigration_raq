General,"(After I click the Validate button on my application form, nothing happens and I don’t see the barcodes. Why?)",https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=767&top=23,,"

There are a few reasons this could happen.


Your version of Adobe Acrobat Reader is out of date.
The forms you need to validate use special encoding. You need Adobe Acrobat Reader 10 (or higher) to use them.


You’re using a cellphone, tablet or other mobile device.
The barcode forms don’t work on these kinds of devices.


You’re missing information in mandatory fields.
Mandatory fields are those marked with an asterisk (*).
When you click on the validation button, the PDF checks that you entered all the mandatory fields. If any are not complete, you won’t be able to validate the form


The dates you entered are conflicting or not in the right format.
Dates must be entered in the format of (YYYY-MM-DD)
You won’t be able to validate the form if you enter conflicting dates, such as

using a date in the past for the date you plan to travel to Canada
entering a future date for your birth date



You entered special characters into the form.
You cannot use special characters on our forms including spaces. Make sure to remove any spaces in fields that should be empty by pressing the backspace or delete button you may have entered by mistake.


There are also 2 known technical issues:

Mac users: the new version of Adobe Acrobat Reader (DC) may cause some issues.
		
Download an older version of Adobe Acrobat Reader (11.0.10)



JavaScript: The validation feature needs to use JavaScript within Adobe Acrobat Reader.
Solution:

To turn JavaScript on, open Adobe Acrobat Reader, click on “Edit,” then “Preferences,” then “JavaScript.”
Check the box beside “Enable JavaScript” and click OK.



After making any changes or downloading new software, download a new version of the form and re-enter your information.
If you’re still having issues, find out how to let us know about technical problems.

General,"(An officer asked me to provide a document in my account, but I’m missing information. What do I do?)",https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1358&top=23,,"

Before you upload the document the officer asked you for, you need to enter information  about it. In some cases, the document won’t have all the information that you need to enter.
In this case:

check your document carefully to make sure you haven’t missed anything
enter any of the information you have 
fill out the missing fields as follows:
  
for the “Document Number,” enter “000000” 
for the “Expiry Date,” select a date that’s one year later than the date of issue



If you’re asking for an extension to get a Police Certificate for your eTA application:

for the “Document name,” enter “Request for an extension”
for the “Country of issue,” choose your country of citizenship from the drop-down menu

General,(Are the fees the same for an adopted child for the permanent residence and citizenship processes?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=406&top=2,,"

No. The fees for permanent residence and citizenship applications differ. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Citizenship Act also use different age ranges for their fees.
Permanent residence
A sponsorship fee and processing fee are required. If, when applying, the adopted person 19 years of age or over, the processing fee is higher. See the fees list for sponsorship and processing fees for permanent residence.
Citizenship
A separate processing fee is required. If, when applying, the adopted person is an adult (18 or older), the processing fee is higher and the right of citizenship fee is required. See the fees list for the processing and right of citizenship fees.
",8/15/2023 18:28
General,(Are there any age exemptions for eTA?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1043&top=23,,"

No. All eTA-required  travellers,  regardless of their age, will need an eTA when they fly to Canada.
",8/15/2023 18:36
General,(Are there any countries where I should get police certificates from before applying for immigration?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=038&top=4,,"

Yes. Those countries are listed in the instruction guide that comes with your application package.
Learn more about police certificates.
",8/15/2023 18:34
General,(Are there countries from which I cannot adopt?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=407&top=2,,"

The list of countries with restrictions or suspensions can change at any time.
",8/15/2023 18:28
General,"(As a Canadian citizen living in Canada, can I apply for an eTA for my non-Canadian relative or friend who lives abroad?)",https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1179&top=23,,"

Yes, a Canadian citizen may help a non-Canadian  relative or friend apply for an eTA. You will need to indicate at the start of  the form that you are completing the form for your relative or friend. 
 When you start the application form:

Answer “yes” to “Are  you a representative or a parent/guardian applying on behalf of an eTA  applicant?”

If your relative or friend is less than 18 years  old, answer “yes” to “Are  you applying on behalf of a minor child?”


You will then see a screen that asks for some  information about yourself. Once you complete  that section, you will be brought to the application form itself, where you can  enter your relative or friend’s information.
On this screen (the application form), make sure to:
    
enter all details correctly (particularly your  relative or friend’s passport number); and
enter your  relative or friend’s email address in the Contact Details section so that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) can communicate directly  with them about their application.  



",8/15/2023 18:38
General,(Can a business or agency organizing charter flights to Canada for tour groups get eTAs for their clients?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1093&top=23,,"

No, group applications are not possible. Travellers from eTA-required countries who fly to or transit through Canada, whether through regular airline or chartered group, are expected to have an eTA.
",8/15/2023 18:37
General,"(Can diplomats who are not accredited in Canada, but accredited elsewhere, travel to Canada without an eTA?)",https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1120&top=23,,"

No. All visa-exempt diplomats who have been accredited by a country other than Canada will need an eTA.
Diplomats who are accredited in Canada do not need an eTA. 
",8/15/2023 18:38
General,(Can I adopt a child from countries experiencing armed conflict or natural disasters?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1202&top=2,,"

No. Canada follows the recommendations set out by the Hague Convention: Children from countries suffering from armed conflicts and natural disasters should not be considered for international adoption, and family tracing should be the priority in all cases.
",8/15/2023 18:28
General,(Can I also apply for a study permit through this accelerated process?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1636&top=20,,"

No. Applying for a study permit is still a separate process and hasn’t changed.

",8/15/2023 18:43
General,(Can I apply for an eTA for my child?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1172&top=23,,"

Yes. To apply for your child, you need to submit a separate application form. You will need to enter a few things differently on your child’s form:

When you start the application form:
    
Answer âyesâ to âAre you applying on behalf of someone?â
Answer âyesâ to âAre you applying on behalf of a minor child?â


You will then see a screen called Parent/guardian or representative details that asks for some information about yourself.
Once you complete that section, you will be brought to the application form itself, where you can enter your child’s information.
    
On this screen (the application form), make sure to:
        
enter all details correctly (particularly your child’s passport number); and
enter your email address or - if you prefer - your child’s email address in the Contact Details section so that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) can communicate with you about the application.
enter your child’s name in the Signature field of the Consent section.





",8/15/2023 18:38
General,(Can I apply for an eTA using a document other than a passport?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1121&top=23,,"

No. You can only apply for an eTA using a valid passport issued to you by your country of citizenship or nationality.

",8/15/2023 18:38
General,(Can I apply for an eTA with a Refugee Travel Document?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1180&top=23,,"

No. Most people using a Refugee Travel Document to travel to Canada will need a visitor visa.
Exceptions:

If you have a valid Canadian Refugee Travel document, you are exempt from both the visa and eTA requirements.
If you’re a lawful permanent resident of the United States and don’t have a passport, you can travel to Canada with your valid U.S. Refugee Travel Document (I-571) and official proof of your lawful permanent resident status.

Complete list of acceptable status documents for lawful permanent residents of the U.S.

foreign passport with a temporary I-551 printed notation (“Upon endorsement serves as temporary I-551 evidencing permanent residence for 1 year”) on a machine-readable immigrant visa upon endorsement with a U.S. Customs and Border Protection admission stamp
expired permanent resident card (Form I-551) with Form I-797 (Notice of Action) for pending Form I-751 (Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence) or Form I-829 (Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status)
expired permanent resident card (Form I-551) with Form I-797 (Notice of Action) for pending Form I-90 (Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card [green card])
valid re-entry permit (Form I-327)

General,(Can I change the email address for my Permanent Residence Portal account?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1651&top=23,,"

You can’t change the email address you use to sign in to your portal account.
If you have a new email or can’t access your old one, you have 2 options:

If you haven’t submitted your application yet, you can create a new account with your new email through the
    
Permanent Resident Portal
Representative Permanent Resident Portal (if you’re a representative)


If you’ve already submitted your application, you can change the email your account updates are sent to. Contact us through the webform and we’ll send account updates to your new email.

General,"(Can I email my new address to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)?)",https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=623&top=4,,"

No, you canât email us directly with your new address. Find out how to change your address.
",8/15/2023 18:35
General,(Can I get personal information about someone else?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=465&top=1,,"

To get personal information belonging to someone else, you must submit their written consent authorizing you to receive their personal information. Consent may be provided by:

completing the Consent for an Access to Information and Personal Information Request – IMM 5744, or 

a written statement that includes:

		
the name of the person giving the consent,
the name of the person to whom consent is being given,
the signature of the person giving the consent and
the date the letter was signed. 



You do not need consent to get the personal information of any dependants who are under 18 years of age.
",8/15/2023 18:27
General,(Can I get personal information about someone who is deceased?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=466&top=1,,"

Yes, you can get someone’s personal information if they died at least 20 years ago. You must provide reasonable proof of death, such as

an obituary notice
a death certificate
photographs of a tombstone or
provincial vital statistics

If a person has been dead for less than 20 years, only the following people can get their personal information: 

the executor of the estate or
in the case of a person who has died without a will, the administrator of the estate

The executor or administrator of the estate does not have an unlimited right of access to all of the deceased’s personal information, but only the information that will allow them to fulfill their legal responsibilities to finalize the estate.

General,(Can I go to a port of entry to give biometrics if it’s closer than a Service Canada location?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1506&top=19,,"

No. Only certain people can give their fingerprints and photo (biometrics) at a Canadian port of entry (POE).
For example, students and workers who meet the specific eligibility requirements can give their biometrics at a POE only if they begin and complete their application for a study or work permit at the POE.
All other applicants must give their biometrics at an official biometrics collection location. If you already have a biometrics instruction letter, this means you can’t give your biometrics at a POE.
Find out if you need to give biometrics, and if you do, how to give you biometrics.

General,(Can I help a friend or family member apply for an eTA?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1178&top=23,,"

Yes, you may help a friend or family member apply for an eTA. You will need to indicate at the start of the form that you are completing the form for your friend or family member.
When you start the application form:

Answer âyesâ to âAre you applying on behalf of someone?â
If your friend or family member is less than 18 years old, answer âyesâ to âAre you applying on behalf of a minor child?â
    
You will then see a screen called Parent/guardian or representative details that asks for some information about yourself.
Once you complete that section, you will be brought to the application form itself, where you can enter your friend or family member’s information.


On the next screen (the application form), make sure to:
    
enter all details correctly (particularly your friend or family member’s passport number); and
enter your friend’s email address in the Contact Details section so that we can communicate directly with them about their application.

General,(Can I see my application status on CAS if I have appealed a decision on my sponsorship application?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=297&top=3,,"

There are a few reasons why you may not be able to see your case  status in the Client Application Status (CAS) tool.
We haven’t started processing your application
Your status will only show once we start processing your application. There’s a delay between the date we receive your application and the date we open and process it.
The tool doesn’t support your application type
The CAS tool can’t see all application types. You may need to check your status a different way.
If you applied

online through the IRCC secure account, sign in to your account to check your status
for an electronic travel authorization (eTA), check using the Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) Status tool

see also: What to do if you haven’t received any emails about your eTA

on paper, you may be able to link your application to your online account

Use the application status tracker if you applied

to sponsor a spouse, partner or dependent children
for all programs under Express Entry (EE):

Canadian Experience Class
Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)
Federal Skilled Workers Program
Federal Skilled Trades Program


If you’re a representative, designated person, or principal applicant, you can use this tracker too.
Find out how to check the status for your application by answering a few questions.
We removed your application from the tool
After we make a decision, we eventually remove your application from the CAS tool. The length of time depends on  the type of application.

Permanent resident applications: 180 days after you arrive in Canada
Permanent resident card applications: 30 days after you get your card
Citizenship applications: 180 days after we make a decision
Visa applications: 365 days after you were refused, you withdrew or your application expired

You entered the wrong personal information
Make sure the information you enter matches your passport or identity documents.
There is a temporary technical issue 
You won’t be able to access online  services if there’s system maintenance.

You’re not the sponsor or principal applicant on the application
For sponsorship applications, you can only check the application status for your part of the application.

The sponsor can only see the sponsorship part of the application
The person being sponsored can only see the permanent residence part of the application

If you’re a sponsor and want to check the status of the person you’re sponsoring, you must first request access to  their information.
The information was changed on your sponsorship application
If you were able to see the status of your  sponsorship application but no longer can, find out why.
You appealed a decision on your sponsorship application
Because the appeal process is complex, CAS doesn’t show the status  of an appeal for a refused family class application. This is true whether the  appeal was filed by the sponsor or by the person being sponsored. The sponsor  will get a letter about the status of the appeal.

Non-residents of Canada are only eligible to make requests for their own personal information under the Privacy Act.
However, you may consider the following options for seeking other personal information records from IRCC:


If the personal information you seek pertains to an individual who has been deceased for more than 20 years, you may ask a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident to submit an Access to Information Act request on your behalf. Please note that any available records will be provided directly to the individual who submitted the request.
You may also wish to consult Library and Archives Canada’s Genealogy and Family History website for information about their records and resources.

If the personal information you seek pertains to an individual who is living, you may submit a request under the Privacy Act for the individual’s personal information but only with that individual’s written consent. This written authorization must state that you are permitted to make a request and receive information on the individual’s behalf.

General,(Do the criteria for permanent residence and for a grant of citizenship differ for adopted children?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=405&top=2,,"

Yes. For an adopted person to be eligible for a direct grant of citizenship for adopted persons at least one of the adoptive parents must be a Canadian citizen at the time of the adoption, or, for adoptions that took place prior to January 1, 1947, at least one adoptive parent must have become a Canadian citizen on January 1, 1947 (or April 1, 1949, in the case of Newfoundland and Labrador for adoptions that took place prior to April 1, 1949) and be able to pass on Canadian citizenship to the adopted person. Other types of custody arrangements and adoption-like situations (guardianships) do not meet the requirements for a direct grant of citizenship for adopted persons. The adoptive parent must be eligible to pass on citizenship by descent.
If you choose to apply for citizenship through the direct grant of citizenship, your child will be affected by the first-generation limit to citizenship by descent. That means they will not be able to:

pass on their citizenship to any children they may have outside Canada; or
apply for a direct grant for any children they later adopt outside Canada, unless the co-sponsor for the adoption is a Canadian citizen by birth in Canada or through naturalization.

Both Canadian citizens and permanent residents can use the immigration process for their adopted children if the adopted person is going to live in Canada right after the adoption.
Another difference between the two processes is the adopted child does not have to undergo a medical exam or background checks when applying for a direct grant of citizenship. These are  requirements when applying for permanent residence.
Where the requirements are the same for both types of applications, the adoption must:

be in the best interests of the child;
create a genuine parent-child relationship that permanently severs the legal ties to the child’s biological parents;
accord with the laws of the country where the adoption took place and the laws where the adoptive parents live; and
not have been entered into primarily to get a citizenship or immigration status or privilege.

If the adoption took place after the person turned 18:

all the requirements listed above must be met (except for the “best interests of the child”);
a genuine parent-child relationship must have existed when the adoption took place; and
that relationship must have existed before the adopted person turned 18.

In addition to these requirements, the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act introduced a new requirement for direct grants of citizenship for adopted persons that the adoption must not have occurred in a manner that circumvented the legal requirements for international adoptions.

General,"(Does an adopted child need a travel document, like a visa, to come to Canada?)",https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=402&top=2,,"

Yes. Before bringing your child to Canada, you must apply for the necessary travel document in order for your child to legally enter Canada. The document is either a permanent resident visa, or a Canadian passport through a grant of citizenship. To avoid unnecessary delays and costs, adoptive parents should not plan to return to Canada with the adopted child until they know with certainty that all immigration or citizenship requirements have been met.

General,(How can I extend my stay as a student?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=475&top=4,,"

If you want to study in Canada longer, you need to extend your study permit.
You should apply to extend your study permit at least 30 days before your current permit expires. However, we recommend you apply more than 30 days before it expires.
If you need to renew your Social Insur ance Number (SIN) or health insurance, you need a valid study permit. If you wait until there are only 30 days left, you may have problems renewing these, because your study permit will be expiring.
Check the processing times to find out how long it may take to have your study permit extended.
Find out how to apply to extend your study permit.
If your study permit has already expired
If you applied to extend your study permit before it expired, but haven’t received a decision on your application, you’re allowed to stay in Canada because you’ve maintained your status. This means you’re a temporary resident until we decide on your application. You can keep studying until you get a decision on your application.
If you haven’t applied to extend your study permit, you lost your status in Canada. You can’t continue or restart your studies until we’ve restored your status and issued a new study permit. You have 90 days to apply to restore your status and extend your permit. There’s a CAN$200 fee to restore your status, as well as a CAN$150 fee for the new study permit. Find out what to do if your study permit has expired and you haven’t applied to extend it.
If youâre planning to travel outside of Canada
Make sure you have the travel document you need to be able to re-enter Canada. You must have a valid travel document to be able to re-enter the country.
Learn more about travelling outside of Canada when youâve applied to extend your study permit.
If youâve applied for a different permit
If you were a student, but youâve applied for a work permit instead, you canât keep studying while you wait for a decision on your application. You also canât work until weâve approved your application. You can stay in Canada as a temporary resident until you get a decision on your application.

Intercountry adoptions are a two step process.  First, there is the adoption process, which involves your province or territory of residence and the country from which you want to adopt. Please consult the intercountry adoption authority in your home province/territory for more information on how to adopt.
The second step is the immigration or citizenship process. This is where Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada comes in. Once the adoption has been authorized by the adoption authorities of your province/territory and  the country where the child lives, you can proceed with the immigration or citizenship process to bring your adopted child to Canada. You should consult the website to decide which process to use.
We play  no role in the first step of the intercountry adoption process. The immigration or citizenship process cannot proceed until the adoption has been approved by your province or territory and the adoption authority of the country where the child is being adoption from.

Adopting a child in another country takes time. Depending on the child’s country of origin, the process may take two years or longer.
Adoption cases are processed on a priority basis. That is true whether parents are applying for permanent residence or citizenship for their adopted child. There are no significant differences in processing times between the two processes. Find out more about processing times.
Long waits can seem unreasonable when you are anxious to welcome a new family member. However, to protect the child’s rights, international adoption must be a rigorous process. Both your provincial or territorial government in Canada, and the government of the country where the child lives, must approve the adoption.
To ensure the child’s rights are protected, visa officers must be satisfied that:

adoptions are made in the best interests of child;
adopted children have not been sold, trafficked or abducted from their parents; and
documentation for the child is valid.

While not common, in countries where there is evidence of fraud or trafficking, investigations may be required. These investigations may take time.

This happens when you pay in your local currency instead of Canadian dollars. The amount of your refund depends on the exchange rate. When we refund you, the amount you get back reflects the exchange rate on the day we issue the refund. Exchange rates change every day so the amount you get back won’t match what you paid.
The Canadian dollar value of your payment and your refund will always be the same.
Refunding an online payment
We collect and refund online payments in Canadian dollars. When we issue a refund to a card using another currency, your bank will convert it from Canadian dollars for you. We are not involved in this exchange process.
Refunding cheques and other payment methods
If your mailing address at the time of your refund request is overseas, we will issue your refund by cheque or direct deposit in your local currency. We use the exchange rate from the day we issue the refund.

If the visa office has assessed the sponsorship portion but hasn’t started processing the permanent residence portion, you will get a partial refund (C$75 for children under 19 and C$475 for adults 19 or older).
Once the visa office has started processing the permanent residence portion, you will not get a refund.

General,(I have applied for permanent residence. My spouse or partner and children are not coming with me. Do they need to get a medical exam?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=988&top=4,,"

Yes. All of your dependants must have a medical exam done by an approved panel physician, regardless of whether or not they’re coming with you to Canada.
All your dependants must have a medical exam done to make sure they’re admissible to Canada. They must be admissible to be able to be sponsored in the future.
Having inadmissible dependants might make you inadmissible for permanent residence.

General,(I have been charged more than $7 CAD for my eTA on another website. I think I have been scammed. How can I find out and can I get a refund?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1233&top=23,,"

You may have used a legitimate third party service that charges more to get an eTA. These companies do not operate on behalf of the Government of Canada, but have websites that charge extra fees to give information and submit an eTA application to the Government of Canada website. 
The Government of Canada does not issue refunds for extra fees charged by third party websites.
Find out if your eTA is valid
As a first step, use the eTA Check Status tool. Enter the following information:

eTA application number, and 
details from the passport you used to apply
    
passport number,
passport country of issuance,
issue date, and
expiry date.



After submitting these details, you will see information about your eTA on the status screen. This information will confirm whether you are authorized to travel to Canada despite being charged more than $7 CAD.
If it has been more than 72 hours since you applied and if you do not see any information or get an error message when you use the Check Status tool, complete this enquiry form. Note: It can take us several days to answer your enquiry.
If, once the Government of Canada reviews your enquiry, it is confirmed that you do not have an eTA and there is no application in your name, follow these steps:

If you are outside of Canada:
    
contact your local police. 


If you are in Canada:
    
follow the instructions at Canada’s Anti-Fraud Centre or call 1-888-495-8501 toll-free.

General,(I have been refused entry to Canada in the past. Does this mean that I will be refused an eTA?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1086&top=23,,"

A past refusal of entry to Canada, or a refusal of a document to travel to Canada, does not mean you will be refused an eTA.  Each application is assessed on a case-by-case basis. You are encouraged to apply regardless of a previous immigration decision.

No. eTA is a mandatory entry requirement. If you have not been able to get an eTA, you should not plan or undertake any travel to Canada.

No, your child can obtain Canadian citizenship before that recognition if:

the adoption meets the requirements of subsection 5.1(3) of the Citizenship Act; and
the Québec government confirms that the formal recognition is the only part of the adoption process still to be completed.

Please note that a Québec court must formally recognize the adoption for it to have effect in Québec only if the sending country has not ratified the Hague Convention. This is not required in cases where the sending country has ratified the Hague Convention.

General,"(I need to add multiple files to my online application, but there is only one field to upload documents. What can I do?)",https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1160&top=23,,"

You need to combine all your documents into 1 file.

You can only upload 1 file per field. If you try to upload multiple files in the same field, only 1 (the last one you upload) will be saved.
File size limit varies depending on the online application you use. If your file is too big, there are ways to reduce its size.

How to combine documents into 1 file
Text documents

Copy the text from all files into a single document.
If you’re including photos, use the “Insert picture” function instead of copying and pasting.

PDF files
You can combine several PDF files into 1 PDF file.

If you have Acrobat DC, follow the instructions on Adobe’s website.
If you don’t have Acrobat DC or similar software, there are websites and apps you can use to combine your PDF files.
		
Make sure to read their terms of service and privacy policy before using these.
We can’t guarantee the security of these third-party tools. Use them at your own risk. 



Images
You can combine multiple images of your documents into a text document or a PDF file.
When you save a PDF file, select a low resolution (150 DPI or less) or a minimum size setting to keep the document under the file size limit for the online application you use.

For example, when you select “Save as” with Microsoft Word, an “Optimize” menu appears on the panel to the left of the “Save” button. Select “Minimum size” to get the smaller file size.
