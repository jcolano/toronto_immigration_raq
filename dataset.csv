Yes, you may help a friend or family member apply for an eTA. You will need to indicate at the start of the form that you are completing the form for your friend or family member.
When you start the application form:

Answer âyesâ to âAre you applying on behalf of someone?â
If your friend or family member is less than 18 years old, answer âyesâ to âAre you applying on behalf of a minor child?â
    
You will then see a screen called Parent/guardian or representative details that asks for some information about yourself.
Once you complete that section, you will be brought to the application form itself, where you can enter your friend or family member’s information.


On the next screen (the application form), make sure to:
    
enter all details correctly (particularly your friend or family member’s passport number); and
enter your friend’s email address in the Contact Details section so that we can communicate directly with them about their application.
enter your friend or family member’s name in the Signature field of the Consent section.

(Do the criteria for permanent residence and for a grant of citizenship differ for adopted children?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=405&top=2,"

Yes. For an adopted person to be eligible for a direct grant of citizenship for adopted persons at least one of the adoptive parents must be a Canadian citizen at the time of the adoption, or, for adoptions that took place prior to January 1, 1947, at least one adoptive parent must have become a Canadian citizen on January 1, 1947 (or April 1, 1949, in the case of Newfoundland and Labrador for adoptions that took place prior to April 1, 1949) and be able to pass on Canadian citizenship to the adopted person. Other types of custody arrangements and adoption-like situations (guardianships) do not meet the requirements for a direct grant of citizenship for adopted persons. The adoptive parent must be eligible to pass on citizenship by descent.
If you choose to apply for citizenship through the direct grant of citizenship, your child will be affected by the first-generation limit to citizenship by descent. That means they will not be able to:

pass on their citizenship to any children they may have outside Canada; or
apply for a direct grant for any children they later adopt outside Canada, unless the co-sponsor for the adoption is a Canadian citizen by birth in Canada or through naturalization.

Both Canadian citizens and permanent residents can use the immigration process for their adopted children if the adopted person is going to live in Canada right after the adoption.
Another difference between the two processes is the adopted child does not have to undergo a medical exam or background checks when applying for a direct grant of citizenship. These are  requirements when applying for permanent residence.
Where the requirements are the same for both types of applications, the adoption must:

be in the best interests of the child;
create a genuine parent-child relationship that permanently severs the legal ties to the child’s biological parents;
accord with the laws of the country where the adoption took place and the laws where the adoptive parents live; and
not have been entered into primarily to get a citizenship or immigration status or privilege.

If the adoption took place after the person turned 18:

all the requirements listed above must be met (except for the “best interests of the child”);
a genuine parent-child relationship must have existed when the adoption took place; and
that relationship must have existed before the adopted person turned 18.

In addition to these requirements, the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act introduced a new requirement for direct grants of citizenship for adopted persons that the adoption must not have occurred in a manner that circumvented the legal requirements for international adoptions.

(How can I extend my stay as a student?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=475&top=4,"

If you want to study in Canada longer, you need to extend your study permit.
You should apply to extend your study permit at least 30 days before your current permit expires. However, we recommend you apply more than 30 days before it expires.
If you need to renew your Social Insur ance Number (SIN) or health insurance, you need a valid study permit. If you wait until there are only 30 days left, you may have problems renewing these, because your study permit will be expiring.
Check the processing times to find out how long it may take to have your study permit extended.
Find out how to apply to extend your study permit.
If your study permit has already expired
If you applied to extend your study permit before it expired, but haven’t received a decision on your application, you’re allowed to stay in Canada because you’ve maintained your status. This means you’re a temporary resident until we decide on your application. You can keep studying until you get a decision on your application.
If you haven’t applied to extend your study permit, you lost your status in Canada. You can’t continue or restart your studies until we’ve restored your status and issued a new study permit. You have 90 days to apply to restore your status and extend your permit. There’s a CAN$200 fee to restore your status, as well as a CAN$150 fee for the new study permit. Find out what to do if your study permit has expired and you haven’t applied to extend it.
If youâre planning to travel outside of Canada
Make sure you have the travel document you need to be able to re-enter Canada. You must have a valid travel document to be able to re-enter the country.
Learn more about travelling outside of Canada when youâve applied to extend your study permit.
If youâve applied for a different permit
If you were a student, but youâve applied for a work permit instead, you canât keep studying while you wait for a decision on your application. You also canât work until weâve approved your application. You can stay in Canada as a temporary resident until you get a decision on your application.

Please consult the intercountry adoption authority in your home province/territory for more information on how to adopt.
The second step is the immigration or citizenship process. This is where Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada comes in. Once the adoption has been authorized by the adoption authorities of your province/territory and  the country where the child lives, you can proceed with the immigration or citizenship process to bring your adopted child to Canada. You should consult the website to decide which process to use.

(How long will the adoption process take?),https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=403&top=3,"

Adopting a child in another country takes time. Depending on the child’s country of origin, the process may take two years or longer.
Adoption cases are processed on a priority basis. That is true whether parents are applying for permanent residence or citizenship for their adopted child. There are no significant differences in processing times between the two processes. Find out more about processing times.
Long waits can seem unreasonable when you are anxious to welcome a new family member. However, to protect the child’s rights, international adoption must be a rigorous process. Both your provincial or territorial government in Canada, and the government of the country where the child lives, must approve the adoption.
To ensure the child’s rights are protected, visa officers must be satisfied that:

adoptions are made in the best interests of child;
adopted children have not been sold, trafficked or abducted from their parents; and
documentation for the child is valid.

While not common, in countries where there is evidence of fraud or trafficking, investigations may be required. These investigations may take time.

You may have used a legitimate third party service that charges more to get an eTA. These companies do not operate on behalf of the Government of Canada, but have websites that charge extra fees to give information and submit an eTA application to the Government of Canada website. 
The Government of Canada does not issue refunds for extra fees charged by third party websites.
Find out if your eTA is valid
As a first step, use the eTA Check Status tool. Enter the following information:

eTA application number, and 
details from the passport you used to apply
    
passport number,
passport country of issuance,
issue date, and
expiry date.



After submitting these details, you will see information about your eTA on the status screen. This information will confirm whether you are authorized to travel to Canada despite being charged more than $7 CAD.
If it has been more than 72 hours since you applied and if you do not see any information or get an error message when you use the Check Status tool, complete this enquiry form. Note: It can take us several days to answer your enquiry.
